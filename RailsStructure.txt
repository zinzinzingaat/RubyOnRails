You create a new rails application by typing in ' rails new *name of app*'

bundle is a gem that goes to rubygem.org and takes all gems and installs all of them
to get the rails application running

Rails follows MVC structure

When you type in a HTTP GET request. It is received by the Router.
The Router then directs request to appropriate Controller
Controller either renders View and re-directs to appropriate page
or Controller reaches out to the Model.
Model then based on the request reaches out to the Database and updates the information
and sends it back to the Controller which then render the View

Under 'app' you will see 'controllers', 'models' and 'views' folder
The routes of the application are in the 'config' folder under 'routes.rb'

Under 'app' , in the 'assests' folder, images,stylesheets, javascript code are housed
'helpers' have common logic for views

Under 'config' , database.yml tells you how your app is communicating with the database
 In 'db' folder all migration files go. The files used to create tables.
 
 In 'Gemfile' , all gems used by Ruby on Rails are housed.
